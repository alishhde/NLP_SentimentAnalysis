# Natural Language Processin - Sentiment Analysis

The notebook existing here, is an implementation of Logistic Regression algorithm in Natural Language Processing, To classify the tweets based on their sentiment.

To implement this model I have used below tools:
- Python - Programming Language
- Jupyter notebook
- Gradient Descent as cost function
- Logistic Regression as classifier
- Pandas, Numpy, nltk, ...
- Datasets from tweets
- ...


`Note` I have learnt this project's topics and implementation from week one of NLP course offerd by university of Stanford, published by Coursera

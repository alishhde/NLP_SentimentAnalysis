# Natural Language Processing - Sentiment Analysis

As it appears from the name of the each notebook, I have implemented Naive Bayes and Logistice Regression algorithms to analyse the sentiment of tweets.

To implement this model I have used below tools:
- Python - Programming Language
- Jupyter notebook
- Gradient Descent as cost function
- Logistic Regression as the model classifier
- Naive Bayes as the model classifier
- Pandas, Numpy, nltk, ...
- Datasets from tweets
- ...

Notebooks are tried to be written in a way that you can learn the implementation and topics from it. So if you have a minimum knowledge of python and machine learning, you can understand these notebooks and learn how we analysed the Sentiment of the tweets. 


`Note` I have learnt this project's topics and implementation from the NLP course offerd by university of Stanford, published by Coursera.
